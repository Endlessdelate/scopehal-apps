\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes a de-facto standard.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To achieve this, non-free programs must\line be allowed to use the library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line }

>, it gives an\line impression that the author could be willing to give an explicit\line permission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So\line probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a\line permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files\line in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the\line version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming\line from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.\line \line ===================================\line Headers and IDLs imported from Wine\line ===================================\line \line Some header and IDL files were imported from the Wine project.

These don't apply to the binaries built with\line MinGW-w64 unless you specifically tell MinGW-w64 to link against\line these parts, for example, by enabling profiling code.\line \line In addition to the notices in this file, also the notices in\line COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt apply to MinGW-w64. Some (possibly\line all) notices in that file may apply also to the binaries built with\line this version of MinGW-w64. The idea is that if you create binary\line packages of your software with MinGW-w64, you can simply copy\line COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt into your package to fulfill the\line license requirements of the MinGW runtime.\line \line If you think that not all notices apply to your package and want to\line remove some of them, note that, for example, the gdtoa files always\line get linked in if you use any printf-like function. So usually it is\line easiest and safest to just keep all the notices.\line \line \line ====================\line GCC and GNU binutils\line ====================\line \line Copyright (C) Free Software Foundation\line License: GNU GPLv3+ (see the file COPYING.GPLv3)\line \line \line ==============\line Profiling code\line ==============\line \line Copyright 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 Red Hat, Inc.\line License: GNU GPLv2+ (see the file COPYING.GPLv2)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 *\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 *\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 *\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 *\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 *\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 *\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 *\line \line Copyright (c) 1982, 1983, 1986, 1992, 1993\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Regents of the University of California.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 All rights reserved.\line \line Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\line modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\line are met:\line 1.

>\line \line Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\line license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line \line This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional\line permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version\line 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that\line bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\line the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\line \line When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\line certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\line program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\line non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\line header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\line \line 0. Definitions.\line \line A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime\line Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\line interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\line on the Runtime Library.\line \line "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\line modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\line the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\line subsequent versions published by the FSF.\line \line "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,\line modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\line the license of GCC.\line \line "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\line target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\line input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\line phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\line format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\line for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\line \line The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in\line non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\line Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\line use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\line part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\line understood as starting with the output of the generators or\line preprocessors.\line \line A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or\line with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\line work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\line optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\line Eligible Compilation Process.\line \line 1. Grant of Additional Permission.\line \line You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\line combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\line propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\line all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\line may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\line consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\line \line 2.

if you modify it.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes\line a de-facto standard.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20

You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must supply a copy of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 executable containing the modified Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (It is understood\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 to use the modified definitions.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 least three years, to give the same user the materials\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 than the cost of performing this distribution.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 specified materials from the same place.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 7.

that you can do\line these things.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes\line a de-facto standard.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20

You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must supply a copy of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 executable containing the modified Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (It is understood\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 to use the modified definitions.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 least three years, to give the same user the materials\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 than the cost of performing this distribution.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 specified materials from the same place.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 7.

share and change it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line }

\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line }

\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 4.

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line }

\u8198\'20 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes\line a de-facto standard.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 in the event an application does not supply such function or\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 its purpose remains meaningful.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 application.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 root function must still compute square roots.)\line \line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line \line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line \line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must supply a copy of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 executable containing the modified Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (It is understood\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 to use the modified definitions.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 least three years, to give the same user the materials\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 than the cost of performing this distribution.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 specified materials from the same place.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 7.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line \line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line \line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line \line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line \line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 NO WARRANTY\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 15.

\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes a de-facto standard.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To achieve this, non-free programs must\line be allowed to use the library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line }

So\line probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a\line permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files\line in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the\line version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming\line from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.\line \line ===================================\line Headers and IDLs imported from Wine\line ===================================\line \line Some header and IDL files were imported from the Wine project.

These don't apply to the binaries built with\line MinGW-w64 unless you specifically tell MinGW-w64 to link against\line these parts, for example, by enabling profiling code.\line \line In addition to the notices in this file, also the notices in\line COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt apply to MinGW-w64. Some (possibly\line all) notices in that file may apply also to the binaries built with\line this version of MinGW-w64. The idea is that if you create binary\line packages of your software with MinGW-w64, you can simply copy\line COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt into your package to fulfill the\line license requirements of the MinGW runtime.\line \line If you think that not all notices apply to your package and want to\line remove some of them, note that, for example, the gdtoa files always\line get linked in if you use any printf-like function.

are not derived from the Program,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\line \line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Program.\line \line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\line with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 3.

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\line except as expressly provided under this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Any attempt\line otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\line void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\line However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\line this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line parties remain in full compliance.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Program or its derivative works.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Program or works based on it.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\line these terms and conditions.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Program at all.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\line \line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line \line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\line implemented by public license practices.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line \line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line \line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 8.

\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line }

\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\line software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\line transforming the program into proprietary software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To prevent this,\line we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\line free use or not licensed at all.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\line GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This\line license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\line designated libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license is quite different from the ordinary\line one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\line the same as in the ordinary license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\line they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\line program and simply using it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Linking a program with a library, without\line changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\line analogous to running a utility program or application program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, in\line a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\line derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\line treats it as such.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\line Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\line sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We\line concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\line users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\line libraries themselves.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This Library General Public License is intended to\line permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\line preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\line libraries that are incorporated in them.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (We have not seen how to achieve\line this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\line changes in the actual functions of the Library.)\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The hope is that this\line will lead to faster development of free libraries.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\line works together with the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\line General Public License rather than by this special one.\line }

more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly\line the order listed) before diving into the code.\line \line \line OVERVIEW\line ========\line \line This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,\line and transcoding.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression\line method for full-color and grayscale images.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 JPEG's strong suit is compressing\line photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and\line brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Images with sharp lines or\line other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG\line quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such\line images.\line \line JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to\line the input pixels.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, on photographic content and other "smooth" images,\line very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression\line artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are\line willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the "quality" setting in the\line compressor.)\line \line This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive\line compression processes.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Provision is made for supporting all variants of these\line processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.\line We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless\line processes defined in the standard.\line \line We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,\line plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to\line perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.\line The library is intended to be reused in other applications.\line \line In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included\line considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;\line for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG\line decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or\line colormapped displays.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These extra functions can be compiled out of the\line library if not required for a particular application.\line \line We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between\line different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple\line applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.\line \line The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and\line flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In particular,\line the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (See the\line REFERENCES section for introductory material.)\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Rather, it is intended to\line be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We do not claim to have\line achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.\line \line We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.\line No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product\line documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.\line \line \line LEGAL ISSUES\line ============\line \line

The SSE/SSE2 floating point DCT implementation in libjpeg-turbo is ever so\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 slightly more accurate than the implementation in libjpeg v6b, but not by\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 any amount perceptible to human vision (generally in the range of 0.01 to\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 0.08 dB gain in PNSR.)\line \line - When not using the SIMD extensions, libjpeg-turbo uses the more accurate\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (and slightly faster) floating point IDCT algorithm introduced in libjpeg\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 v8a as opposed to the algorithm used in libjpeg v6b.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It should be noted,\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 however, that this algorithm basically brings the accuracy of the floating\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 point IDCT in line with the accuracy of the accurate integer IDCT.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 floating point DCT/IDCT algorithms are mainly a legacy feature, and they do\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 not produce significantly more accuracy than the accurate integer algorithms\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (to put numbers on this, the typical difference in PNSR between the two\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 algorithms is less than 0.10 dB, whereas changing the quality level by 1 in\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 the upper range of the quality scale is typically more like a 1.0 dB\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 difference.)\line \line - If the floating point algorithms in libjpeg-turbo are not implemented using\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 SIMD instructions on a particular platform, then the accuracy of the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 floating point DCT/IDCT can depend on the compiler settings.\line \line While libjpeg-turbo}

does emulate the libjpeg v8 API/ABI, under the hood it is\line still using the same algorithms as libjpeg v6b, so there are several specific\line cases in which libjpeg-turbo cannot be expected to produce the same output as\line libjpeg v8:\line \line - When decompressing using scaling factors of 1/2 and 1/4, because libjpeg v8\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 implements those scaling algorithms differently than libjpeg v6b does, and\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 libjpeg-turbo's SIMD extensions are based on the libjpeg v6b behavior.\line \line - When using chrominance subsampling, because libjpeg v8 implements this\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 with its DCT/IDCT scaling algorithms rather than with a separate\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 downsampling/upsampling algorithm.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In our testing, the subsampled/upsampled\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 output of libjpeg v8 is less accurate than that of libjpeg v6b for this\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 reason.\line \line - When decompressing using a scaling factor > 1 and merged (AKA "non-fancy" or\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 "non-smooth") chrominance upsampling, because libjpeg v8 does not support\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 merged upsampling with scaling factors > 1.\line \line \line Performance Pitfalls\line ====================\line \line Restart Markers\line ---------------\line \line The optimized Huffman decoder in libjpeg-turbo does not handle restart markers\line in a way that makes the rest of the libjpeg infrastructure happy, so it is\line necessary to use the slow Huffman decoder when decompressing a JPEG image that\line has restart markers.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This can cause the decompression performance to drop by\line as much as 20%, but the performance will still be much greater than that of\line libjpeg.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Many consumer packages, such as Photoshop, use restart markers when\line generating JPEG images, so images generated by those programs will experience\line this issue.\line \line Fast Integer Forward DCT at High Quality Levels\line -----------------------------------------------\line \line The algorithm used by the SIMD-accelerated quantization function cannot produce\line correct results whenever the fast integer forward DCT is used along with a JPEG\line quality of 98-100.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Thus, libjpeg-turbo must use the non-SIMD quantization\line function in those cases.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This causes performance to drop by as much as 40%.\line It is therefore strongly advised that you use the accurate integer forward DCT\line whenever encoding images with a JPEG quality of 98 or higher.\line \line \line Memory Debugger Pitfalls\line ========================\line \line Valgrind and Memory Sanitizer (MSan) can generate false positives\line (specifically, incorrect reports of uninitialized memory accesses) when used\line with libjpeg-turbo's SIMD extensions.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It is generally recommended that the\line SIMD extensions be disabled, either by passing an argument of `-DWITH_SIMD=0`\line to `cmake` when configuring the build or by setting the environment variable\line `JSIMD_FORCENONE` to `1` at run time, when testing libjpeg-turbo with Valgrind,\line MSan, or other memory debuggers.\line ;\line ; jsimdext.inc - common declarations\line ;\line ; Copyright 2009 Pierre Ossman <ossman@cendio.se> for Cendio AB\line ; Copyright (C) 2010, 2016, 2019, D.

\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line }

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes\line a de-facto standard.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 in the event an application does not supply such function or\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 its purpose remains meaningful.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 application.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 root function must still compute square roots.)\line \line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line \line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line \line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must supply a copy of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 executable containing the modified Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (It is understood\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 to use the modified definitions.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 least three years, to give the same user the materials\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 than the cost of performing this distribution.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 specified materials from the same place.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 7.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line \line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line \line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line \line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line \line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 NO WARRANTY\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 15.

\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\line software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\line transforming the program into proprietary software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To prevent this,\line we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\line free use or not licensed at all.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\line GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This\line license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\line designated libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license is quite different from the ordinary\line one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\line the same as in the ordinary license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\line they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\line program and simply using it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Linking a program with a library, without\line changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\line analogous to running a utility program or application program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, in\line a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\line derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\line treats it as such.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\line Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\line sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We\line concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\line users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\line libraries themselves.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This Library General Public License is intended to\line permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\line preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\line libraries that are incorporated in them.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (We have not seen how to achieve\line this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\line changes in the actual functions of the Library.)\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The hope is that this\line will lead to faster development of free libraries.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\line works together with the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\line General Public License rather than by this special one.\line }

share and change it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes\line a de-facto standard.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20

You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You must supply a copy of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 executable containing the modified Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 (It is understood\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 to use the modified definitions.)\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Library.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 least three years, to give the same user the materials\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 than the cost of performing this distribution.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 specified materials from the same place.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line ^L\line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 7.

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\line except as expressly provided under this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Any attempt\line otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\line void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\line However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\line this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line parties remain in full compliance.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Program or its derivative works.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Program or works based on it.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\line these terms and conditions.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Program at all.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\line \line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line \line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\line implemented by public license practices.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line \line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\line those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line of the General Public License from time to time.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Such new versions will\line be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line address new problems or concerns.\line \line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the Program\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\line later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\line either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\line Software Foundation.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 If the Program does not specify a version number of\line this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\line Foundation.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\line to ask for permission.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 For software which is copyrighted by the Free\line Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\line make exceptions for this.\u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 Our decision will be guided by the two goals\line of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\line of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 NO WARRANTY\line \line \u8198\'20 \u8198\'20 11.
