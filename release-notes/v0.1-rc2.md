# ngscopeclient v0.1-rc2 release notes

This should be very close to the final v0.1 release.

Known bugs:
* MacOS binary packaging is not finished (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/743)
* Application icon is not finished (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/204)
* Docking anchors act funny on MacOS (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/871)
* Title bars of free floating dock spaces have too-large fonts (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/869)
* Node title bars in filter graph look weird on high-DPI (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/868)
* Burst width filter disappears when added to graph (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/807, fixed in git HEAD)
* ChannelPropertiesDialog does not block creation of cycles in filter graph (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/737)
* Some submenus under the Window menu are not disabled if they have no child items (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/732)
* Newly added channels can spawn in plots which are not currently visible making them hard to find (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/657)
* Newly added filters may not have same gain/offset as the plot they spawn in (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/652)
* Eye patterns forget color ramp setting when dragged to a new plot (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/556)
* GUI light mode is mostly nonfunctional because many color defaults are set assuming dark mode and have poor contrast when light mode is selected (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/526)

Other notes:
* Filter graph nodes are reference counted and should (occasionally this does not happen due to dangling reference bugs) self-delete when all consumers of their output (waveform views, filter inputs, etc.) are removed. This is non-ideal from a user experience perspective, but can't be fixed without substantial refactorings (planned for v0.2) and we didn't want to delay shipping v0.1 any further.
