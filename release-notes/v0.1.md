# ngscopeclient v0.1 release notes

## Platform Support

### Supported Platforms

We have tested ngscopeclient on the following platforms and ship official binaries for them.

* Windows 11 (x86-64)
* MacOS 15.6 (Apple Silicon / arm64)
* Linux
  * Arch (x86-64)
  * Debian 12 "Bookworm" (x86-64)
  * Debian 13 "Trixie" (x86-64)
  * Fedora 42 (x86-64)
  * Ubuntu 22.04 (x86-64)
  * Ubuntu 24.04 (x86-64)

### Unsupported client platforms

We have not tested on ARM Windows or Linux, or Linux distros not listed as supported. We welcome test results, successful or otherwise, if you compile from source on these platforms.

There are known packaging issues on Intel Macs, however we hope to resolve these in the v0.2 release.

## What's New

Everything is new, this is the first official release!

## Known bugs

It's not perfect, but if we waited until it was we'd never ship. Here's a few of the most notable quirks you might run into.

* Docking anchors act funny on MacOS (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/871)
* Title bars of free floating dock spaces have too-large fonts (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/869)
* Node title bars in filter graph look weird on high-DPI (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/868)
* Newly added channels can spawn in plots which are not currently visible making them hard to find (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/657)
* Newly added filters may not have same gain/offset as the plot they spawn in (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/652)
* Eye patterns forget color ramp setting when dragged to a new plot (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/556)
* GUI light mode is impractical to use. Many color defaults are set assuming dark mode and have poor contrast when light mode is selected unless dozens of preferences are individually updated to match, and toolbar icons don't have light mode variants (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-apps/issues/526)
* Filter graph nodes are reference counted and should (occasionally this does not happen due to dangling reference bugs) self-delete when all consumers of their output (waveform views, filter inputs, etc.) are removed. This is non-ideal from a user experience perspective, but can't be fixed without substantial refactorings (planned for v0.2) and we didn't want to delay shipping v0.1 any further. v0.2 will eliminate the homegrown reference counting in favor of std::shared_ptr which should completely eliminate this class of bug, as well as making the filter graph bidirectionally traversable which will enable manual deletion of filters and many optimizations such as not computing filter block outputs which are not being displayed or used in computations (https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal/issues/992).
